## Introduction

As a developer, you might have to work on softwares that will be used by hundreds of
persons.

You have learned to develop more or less complex programs without taking security
into account.

With this project, you will quickly realize it’s rather easy to exploit issues that can
be very easily avoided.

Once you’re through with this project, you will have a clearer understanding of the
RAM. And this will really help you design a bugless program!


# Objectives

This project aims to further your knowledge in the world of elf-like binary exploitation
in in i386 system.

The more or less complex methods you will use will gibe you a new perspective on IT
in general but mostly raise your awareness on issues coming from programming common
malpractice.

You will be challenged during this project. You have to overcome these challenges
by yourself. The way you’ll be dealing with these challenges must be yours and YOURS
ONLY. The point is to help you develop some logic and acquire reflexes that will help
you all along your career. Before asking for help, ask yourself if you have factored all the
possibilities in.
